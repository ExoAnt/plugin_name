# This study aims to enrich the understanding of physical objects and their inherent imperfections by applying photogrammetry based color mapping techniques to digital models, thereby enhancing visual representation and interpretation. Challenging traditional architectural practices that emphasize highly accurate scans and dimensions, this research explores the potential of handheld photogrammetry scans to shift the focus towards color and saturation, allowing users to envision the world in a more nuanced manner. By uploading a scan, users can adjust the height of a pyramid that will be generated with a preselected number of sides determined by color intensity.
